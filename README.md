# EX-03  Implementation-of-Linear-Regression-Using-Gradient-Descent

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the profit of a city using the linear regression model with gradient descent.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.Import the standard python libraries for Gradient design.<br>
2.Introduce the variables needed to execute the function.<br>
3.Use function for the representation of the graph.<br>
4.Using for loop apply the concept using the formulae.<br>
5.Execute the program and plot the graph. <br>
6.Predict and execute the values for the given conditions. <br>

## Program:
```
/*

```

## Output:



## Result:
Thus the program to implement the linear regression using gradient descent is written and verified using python programming.
